MongoDB uses a flexible document-oriented data model for data storage. In MongoDB, data is organized and stored in the following way:

1. **Database:**

   - The highest-level container in MongoDB is a database. Each database can contain multiple collections of documents. Databases are separate from one another and can be thought of as analogous to SQL databases.

2. **Collection:**

   - A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is roughly equivalent to a table in a relational database. Collections do not enforce a schema, so documents within a collection can have varying structures. Collections are where data is actually stored.

3. **Document:**
   - A document is a single unit of data in MongoDB, typically represented in BSON (Binary JSON) format. BSON is a binary serialization format used to store documents and make data exchange between the MongoDB server and application more efficient. Documents can contain key-value pairs, arrays, and other nested documents. MongoDB documents are similar in structure to JSON objects.

Here's a more detailed explanation of these components:

- **Document**: A document in MongoDB is a single record or data item that is stored as a set of key-value pairs. It can contain various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, subdocuments, and more. Documents are the basic building blocks of data in MongoDB and are typically analogous to rows in a relational database.

- **Collection**: A collection is a logical grouping of documents. Collections do not enforce a schema, which means that documents within a collection can have different fields and structures. While MongoDB is schema-less in terms of the data itself, collections are still a useful way to organize and manage related data.

- **Database**: Databases serve as containers for collections. In MongoDB, multiple collections can belong to the same database. Databases are isolated from each other and are often used to group related collections, making it easier to manage and secure data.

It's important to note that while MongoDB does not enforce a strict schema for each document, you can still define validation rules for collections if you want to impose structure or constraints on your data. Additionally, the flexibility of MongoDB's data model allows for easy adaptation to changing application requirements, making it suitable for applications with evolving data needs.

Here's an example of how data is organized in MongoDB:

- **Database**: MyCompany
  - **Collections**:
    - Employees
    - Products
    - Orders
  - **Documents** within the "Employees" collection:
    - Employee 1
    - Employee 2
  - **Documents** within the "Products" collection:
    - Product A
    - Product B
    - Product C
  - **Documents** within the "Orders" collection:
    - Order 1
    - Order 2

Each document within a collection can have its own unique structure, and collections can be added, modified, or removed as the application's data requirements evolve.
