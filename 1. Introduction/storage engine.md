A storage engine is the component of a database that is responsible for managing how data is stored, both in memory and on disk. MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

- **WiredTiger (default)**: WiredTiger is the default storage engine for MongoDB starting in version 3.2. It is a high-performance storage engine that provides a document-level concurrency model, checkpointing, and compression. WiredTiger is a good choice for most workloads.

- **MMAPv1 (deprecated)**: MMAPv1 was the default storage engine for MongoDB prior to version 3.2. It is a simple storage engine that uses memory-mapped files to store data. MMAPv1 is not as performant as WiredTiger and is no longer recommended for new deployments.

- **In-Memory**: The in-memory storage engine stores all data in memory. This can provide very fast performance, but it also means that data is not persisted to disk. The in-memory storage engine is a good choice for workloads that require very low latency, but it is not a good choice for workloads that require data durability.

The choice of storage engine can have a significant impact on the performance of a MongoDB deployment. It is important to choose the right storage engine for the workload.

Here is a table summarizing the key features of each storage engine:

| Feature                    | WiredTiger               | MMAPv1 | In-Memory |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------ | --------- |
| Default                    | Yes                      | No     | No        |
| Performance                | High                     | Medium | Very high |
| Durability                 | Yes                      | Yes    | No        |
| Compression                | Yes                      | No     | No        |
| Document-level concurrency | Yes                      | No     | No        |
| Encryption at rest         | Yes (MongoDB Enterprise) | No     | No        |

If you are unsure which storage engine to choose, you can start with WiredTiger. WiredTiger is a good choice for most workloads.
